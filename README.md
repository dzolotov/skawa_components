[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skawa-universe/skawa_components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skawa-universe/skawa_components)

These components and directives are built with [AngularDart](https://pub.dev/packages/angular), and
 based on following the [Material Design principles](https://material.io/guidelines/).

Skawa Material Components goal is to provide a couple of components that seems to be missing from `package:angular_components`.
Skawa Components goal is to share a couple of components whiches are used internally but not material.

Both packages are being actively maintained, meaning components get added and removed.
In case of a component from this list is added to angular_components, it will be 
deprecated and eventually removed from skawa_material_components.


Skawa Material Components and Skawa Components reuses and builds on top of certain parts of `angular_components` package.
